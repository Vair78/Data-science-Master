    "# Restful Service\n",
    "-Restful Services \n",
    "RESTful services, also known as RESTful APIs, are web services that follow the REST architectural style. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a set of principles for building web services that use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful services are based on the following principles: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- Client-server architecture: The client and server are separated, allowing them to evolve independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Stateless: Each request sent to the server contains all the information needed to complete the request. The server does not maintain any client context between requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Cacheable: Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniform interface: RESTful services use a uniform interface consisting of resources, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and hypermedia links. \n",
    "- Layered system: RESTful services can be composed of multiple layers, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and security. \n"
