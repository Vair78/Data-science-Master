    "## Q1. What is Multiprocesing in Python ? Why is it useful ?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiprocessing is a way of running mulitple process in parallel in Python to perfomr different tasks simultaneously on different CPU cores or even different computers.\n",
    "- It allows you to take advantage of modern multi-core processors. and it is useful when you want to speed up your program by dividing the work among multiple CPUs.\n",
    " - In python, the Multiprocessing module provides a way to create and manage processes. It is a way to create a new process that runs concurrenlty with the main process. and it can be used to execute computationally intensive tasks in parallel.\n",
    " - Here are some of the benefits of using multiprocessing in Python.\n",
    " 1) Faster execution :\n",
    "       - By using multiprocessing you can speed up your program by running tasks in parallel on multiple CPUs or even different computers.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) Improved Performance : \n",
    "     - With multiprocessing , you can distribute your program's workload across multiple CPUs or even different computers, which can help to improve the overall performance and reduce the time taken to execute.\n",
    "     \n",
    " 3) Better Resource Management :\n",
    "       - With Multipleprocessing you can manage resources more efficiently, Since each process has its own memory Space and can manage its own resources independently.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   4) Enhanced Scalability : \n",
    "      - Multiprocessing provides a way to scale your program to take advantage of modern Multi-Core Processors and distributed Computing system.\n",
    "       \n",
    "   OVerall, Multiprocessing is a powerful tool that can help you to improve the performance and scalability of your Python Programs by distributing the workload across multiple CPUs or even different Computers.\n",

    "## Q2. What are the difference between multiprocessing and mutithreading ? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Multiprocessing and multithreading are techniques for achieving parallelism and can be used to improve the performance of a program. however, there are some significant difference between the Two :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Memory : In multiprocessing , each process has its own memory space, whereas in multithreading, all threads share the same memory space. This means that processess do not haveaccess to each other's memory. And each process has its own copy of data. In multithreading, threads can access the same memory sapce and can share the data between each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Communication : Inter-process Communicaiton (IPC) is used to communicate between procesess, while inter-thread Communication (ITC) is used to communicate between threads, IPC is slowe than ITC since it requires Serialization and deserialization of data. \n",
    "         In Multithreading, ITC is faster since it doesnot require data to be serialized or deserialized.\n",
    "         \n",
    "3) CPU -Bound vs I/O Bound Tasks : Multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU- bound tasks whre the bottleneck is CPU usage. and Multithreading is more suitable for I/O bound tasks where the bottleneck is I/O operation such as network or disk operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Overhead : \n",
    "    - Multiprocessing has a higher overhad compared to multithreading. as creating and managing processes Requires more system resources than creating and managing threads.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5) Parallelism : Multiprocessing allows parallelism on multiple CPUs or even differnet computers, whereas Multithreading only allows parallelism on a single CPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Multiprocessing and mutithreading are two different techniques for achieving parallelism in Python. Whille Multiprocessing provides better isolation and is more suitable for CPU-Bound tasks. Multithreading is more suitable for I/O -Bound tasks and has lower Overhead."
