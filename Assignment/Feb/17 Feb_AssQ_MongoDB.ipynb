    "* MnogoDB IS a NOSQL. document based databse that store data in JSON-Like documents, making it a popular choice for web and mobile applications that require flexible, saclable and high performance data storage. \n",
    "        It is an Open-Source,Cross platform database that offers high availability , Automatic scaling and horizontal scaling features.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Non-relation databses, also know as NoSQL databses, are databases that do not use a traditional relational database model, which mean they do not use table with rows and columns. Instead they store data in a flexible and schema-less format such as documents, graphs or key-Value pairs, Non-relational databases are often preferred for their flexibility, scalability and performance,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is preferred over SQL databses in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, such as for web application that requirs the storage of large volumes of unstrucuted data, such as social media posts, sensor data, or multimedia files. MongoDB is also a good choice when you need to store large amounts of data that may change frequently, as it allows for schema flexibility and dynamic updates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Summary , MongoDB is popular NoSQL databse that offers hihg performance, Scalability and flexibility. Making it a good choice for web and mobile application that require dynamic and unstrucuted data storage. \n",
    "    Non-relational database, in general are preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where data in Unstructured or Semi-structed and where Scalability and Flexibility are Important."

    "MongoDB is pwoerful, flexible and scalable NoSQL databse that offers many features Including :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1) Document -Orinted storage : MangoDB store data in flexible, JSON like documents, which can have dynamic shcemas and can be nested.\n",
    "    2) High availability :  MongoDB supports replica sets, which are group of MongoDB servers taht maintain multiple copies of data for high availability and automatic failover.\n",
    "    3) Automatice Shareding : MongoDB can automatically partition data across multiple servers, making it easy to scale  horizontally.\n",
    "    4) Indexing : MongoDB supports many types of indexes including compoound indexes, geospatal Indexes and text indexes, which help to optimize query performance.\n",
    "    5) Aggregation Framwork : MongoDB's Aggregation Framework is powerful tool for performing advanced data analysis, grouping and aggregation on data.\n",
    "    6) MapReduce : MongoDB supports MapReduce, a powerful data processing technique that allows for efficient processing of large datasets.\n",
    "    7) Security : MongoDB provides several Security features, Including Authentication, Access control, Encryption at rest and Auditing, to Protect Your Data and ensure Compliance with Security standards.\n",
    "    8) Schema Flexibility : MongoDB's document oriented data model allows for schema flexibility, making it easy to hanlde usntructed and Semi-Structured Data.\n",
    "    9) Dynamic Updates : MongoDB allows for Dynamic udpates so you can easily modify data in real-Time without worrying about shema Changes.\n",

    "delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are methods used in MongoDB to delete documents or collections from the database.\n",

The method takes a filter parameter that specifies the document to be deleted, and it deletes the first document that matches the filter. If no document matches the filter, the method does nothing.\n",

    "\n",
    "drop() is used to delete an entire collection from the database. The method does not take any parameters, and it deletes the entire collection and all of its documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are useful in scenarios where you need to remove data from the database. For example, if you have a collection of user data, you may want to use delete_one() to remove a single user's data when they delete their account, or delete_many() to remove multiple users' data at once. If you decide to remove a collection entirely, you can use the drop() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to be careful when using these methods, as they can permanently delete data from the database. Always make sure you have a backup of your data before performing any delete operations, and double-check that you're deleting the correct documents or collections before executing the delete methods."
