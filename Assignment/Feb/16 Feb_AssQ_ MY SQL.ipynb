    "    A  Database is a colleciton of data that is organized in a structed way allowing for efficient storage, retrival and managment of data. Database can be used to store and manage various types of  data such as Financial records, customer Information , inventory or any other Structued Data.\n",
    "     SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases, each with its own strenghts and weaknesses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* SQL (Strucuted Query language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables wit h predefined chemas. These databses use SQL as their standard query language to manage and retrive data. SQL database are idel for handling structured data. Which is data that is easily organized into rows and columns. Some Example of SQL database include MYSQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Database, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a varity of different wasy such as key-values pairs, document-Oriented databases. Graph databases, and column-Oriented database. \n",
    "    Unlike SQL Database  NoSQL database do not have a predefined shcema, making it easier to store and manage unstructured data. NoSQL databases are typically more scalable and can handle large amounts of data more efficiently that SQL databases. Some Example of NoSQL database include MongoDB, Cassandra and Redis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       The Choice between SQL and NoSQL database largely depends on the specific requirements of the application. SQL database are best suited for application that requires high consistency and transactional integrity. While NoSQL database are better suited for applicaiton that require high scalability. Performance and flexibility in handling Unstructured Data.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns in a table and it serves as a reference to a specific record in the table. The primary key constraint ensures that no two records in the table have the same key values.\n",

    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a link between two tables based on a common field, enabling data to be associated between the two tables. A foreign key constraint ensures that the data in the referencing column of the table exists in the referenced column of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of primary and foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two tables - a customers table and an orders table. Each record in the orders table is associated with a specific customer in the customers table. To link the two tables, we can create a foreign key column in the orders table that references the primary key column in the customers table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key column in the customers table could be the customer ID column, which would be a unique identifier for each customer. The foreign key column in the orders table could be the customer ID column as well, which would reference the customer ID column in the customers table.\n",

    "The relationship between the two tables is established when the foreign key in the orders table is created as a reference to the primary key in the customers table. This enables us to associate each order with a specific customer, making it easy to retrieve information about the orders for a particular customer.\n",

    "In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table, while a foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The use of primary and foreign keys enables the creation of relationships between tables in a relational database."
